# Nice Updater 2

A tool to faciliate the updating of macOS that (nicely) gives the user several reminders to update before becomgin really annoying.

This fork uses swiftDialog instead of Yo.app. Additional configuration opportunities have also been added.

Version 2 removes the use of `softwareupdate` for installing updates that require a restart. Updates that can be carried out without a restart are still performed using `softwareupdate`. For those that require a restart, the Software Update pane is opened instead.
